# Lakehouse-Storage-Layer
The storage layer is the heart of any data platform. In platforms based on lakehouse architecture, it plays a significant role in efficiently persisting all types of data and improving the performance of queries


1Ô∏è‚É£ Storage Layer (Data Lake / Cloud Object Storage)
In the Databricks Lakehouse, your data (including Parquet files) is physically stored in:

AWS ‚Üí Amazon S3
Azure ‚Üí Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS)
GCP ‚Üí Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

Example:

ruby
Copy
Edit
s3://your-bucket/datalake/order-fallouts/
This is your raw or curated data in open formats like Parquet, Delta Lake, Avro, etc.

‚úÖ Why here?
It separates compute from storage, making it scalable and cost-effective.


üìä 2Ô∏è‚É£ Metadata Layer (Delta Lake / Hive Metastore / Unity Catalog)
Databricks stores metadata (table schema, versions, partitions) in:

Delta Lake transaction log (_delta_log)
Unity Catalog / Hive Metastore
This enables:

ACID transactions
Time Travel (query historical versions)
Schema enforcement & evolution

üîç 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access Layer (Tables / Views / ML Models)
Data stored as Parquet or Delta becomes a table in Databricks:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE order_fallouts
USING DELTA
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/datalake/order-fallouts/'
You can then: ‚úÖ Query it with SparkSQL / Python / Scala
‚úÖ Train ML models on it
‚úÖ Serve results via Dashboards or APIs

‚úÖ Where Does the Machine Learning Model Get Stored?
If you register the model using Databricks MLflow Model Registry, the model artifacts (trained model, metadata) get stored in:

Managed cloud storage (S3 / ADLS / GCS)
MLflow tracking database inside Databricks
Example MLflow artifact URI:

swift
Copy
Edit
dbfs:/databricks/mlflow-tracking/your-experiment-id/artifacts/model/

üíé Summary ‚Äî Full Data Flow in Databricks Lakehouse
Layer	What Gets Stored	Where (Example)
Raw Data	Raw order fallouts (Parquet)	s3://your-bucket/datalake/order-fallouts/
Curated Data	Delta Tables / Feature Tables	s3://your-bucket/curated/order-features/
Metadata	Table schema, partitions, delta logs	Delta Lake _delta_log, Unity Catalog
ML Model Artifacts	Trained Random Forest Model	dbfs:/databricks/mlflow-tracking/.../model/
ML Predictions	Output / Predictions	Written back to Delta table or external target

"In Databricks Lakehouse, our Parquet and Delta data physically resides in cloud object storage like S3 or ADLS. The Delta Lake transaction log ensures ACID compliance. For machine learning, we register our models using MLflow, which stores model artifacts in DBFS and tracks experiments. This architecture allows us to seamlessly query, train models, and serve predictions at scale." 


Simple Rule of Thumb
Ask This	If Yes ‚Üí Persist	If No ‚Üí Cache/Stream
Will this data impact business operations?		
Is this needed for audits, compliance, or billing?		
Will multiple systems or users need this later?		
Will you perform reporting or analytics on it?		

# Don't persist this - temporary data
session_cache['user_1234'] = 'authenticated'

# Persist this - impacts billing
db.insert('usage_records', {'customer': 'ABC', 'data_used': 100, 'timestamp': now})
