# Lakehouse-Storage-Layer
The storage layer is the heart of any data platform. In platforms based on lakehouse architecture, it plays a significant role in efficiently persisting all types of data and improving the performance of queries

When sending legacy OSS (Operational Support Systems) data to Salesforce for a data-intensive telecom application, the volume and type of data depend on the specific use case. Below is an expanded view based on different storage and processing needs:

1. Databases (Persistent Storage)
Volume: High, ranging from terabytes to petabytes of data, depending on historical data retention policies.
Type of Data:
Customer & Subscription Data (e.g., account details, service agreements)
Network Inventory & Asset Data (e.g., routers, circuits, fiber paths)
Billing & Usage Data (e.g., invoices, call records, bandwidth usage)
Service Orders & Trouble Tickets (e.g., MACD, fault reports)
Configuration Management Data (e.g., device settings, IP assignments)
Storage Mechanism:
Salesforce Data Cloud (structured customer data)
External databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake for analytical storage)
2. Caches (Faster Data Retrieval)
Volume: Medium, typically gigabytes to terabytes, depending on cache expiry policies.
Type of Data:
Session Data (e.g., user authentication tokens, temporary preferences)
Frequently Accessed Service Orders (e.g., active orders in progress)
API Responses (e.g., real-time service availability lookups)
Storage Mechanism:
Redis, Memcached for high-speed access
Salesforce Platform Cache for UI performance optimization
3. Search Indexes (Keyword or Filtered Data Search)
Volume: Large-scale, hundreds of millions of records, depending on indexing granularity.
Type of Data:
Fault Tickets & Resolutions (e.g., searching by error codes, impacted sites)
Order Management & Service Records (e.g., filtering by status, region, network type)
Customer & Contract Information (e.g., lookup by phone number, contract ID)
Storage Mechanism:
ElasticSearch for indexing network events
Salesforce Einstein Search for enhanced query capabilities
4. Message Queues (Asynchronous Processing)
Volume: Medium to high, millions of messages per day, varying by traffic spikes.
Type of Data:
Order Status Updates (e.g., provisioning completion, activation)
Network Fault Notifications (e.g., alarms triggered from NMS/EMS)
Billing & Payment Events (e.g., invoice generation, payment received)
Storage Mechanism:
Apache Kafka for high-throughput message handling
AWS SQS or Google Pub/Sub for cloud-based queuing
Salesforce Platform Events for event-driven workflows
5. Stream Processing (Event-Based Actions)
Volume: Very high, billions of events per day for real-time network operations.
Type of Data:
Network Performance Metrics (e.g., latency, packet loss, jitter)
IoT Device & Sensor Data (e.g., temperature, power usage)
Call Detail Records (CDRs) (e.g., real-time voice/data session monitoring)
Storage Mechanism:
Apache Flink, Spark Streaming for real-time analytics
Salesforce Real-Time Event Monitoring for security and compliance
6. Batch Processing (Periodic Data Analysis & Aggregation)
Volume: Extremely high, petabytes over months or years.
Type of Data:
Customer Usage Analytics (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly reports)
Fraud Detection Models (e.g., anomaly detection in call patterns)
Network Capacity Planning (e.g., usage trends, future demand forecasting)
Storage Mechanism:
Databricks for large-scale distributed processing
Snowflake or Google BigQuery for structured analytics
Conclusion
Real-time processing needs: Stream processing + caches + message queues.
Long-term storage & analysis: Databases + batch processing.
High-speed search and filtering: Search indexes.
Event-driven automation: Message queues + event streaming.
